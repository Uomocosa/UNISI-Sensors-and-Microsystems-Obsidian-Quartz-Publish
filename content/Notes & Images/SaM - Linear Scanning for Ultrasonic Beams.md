- In this case if I have an array of many elements called a **sub-array**.<br>As an example we excite only 5 out of 100 transducers.
- Therefore it is like having a small probe in this area here which analyze the region in front of it. 
- Then I can move the active sensors region along the whole array.<br>So I stop exciting the 1st and i excite the 6th.<br>Then I stop exciting the 2nd and i excite the 7th.<br>...
- So it's like moving the probe down.
