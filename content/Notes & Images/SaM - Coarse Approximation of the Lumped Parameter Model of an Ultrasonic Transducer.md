==What I want to outline here is that for sure in this kind of device **we don't have the condition needed for a good approximation with lamped parameter**==.
==So lamped parameter models require a wavelength which is much larger than the dimensions of the piezoelectric crystal==:<br>![[Pasted image 20230720162315.png|500]]
- $\lambda$ : wavelength
- $t$ : thickness of the **piezoelectric** slice.
- $D$ : ??? #TODO *maybe area of the piezoelectric crystal*.

==We need to take into account also **space variation**.<br>So differential equation with partial derivatives, because we have time and space, so both variations need to be taken into account==.
