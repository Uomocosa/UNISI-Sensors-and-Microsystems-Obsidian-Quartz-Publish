Different types of materials have different band structures:

- For **metals** we have two possibilities:
  1. We have a separate conduction bend and valanced bend, but valance band is not fully occupied even at $0Â°$ Kelvin.
  2. Another possibility for forming a metal, here you see that the conduction band and the balance band **overlaps**, there is no gap. <br>That means that the minimum amount of energy for an electron in the valance bend to go into the conduction bend is really small, almost $0$.
- The difference between semiconductors and insulator is the **width of the energy gap**. 

==The energy gap depends on **temperature**==:

Here you see same picture, it shows you that actually the density of states in the band is not constant, but varies and there is a maximum and the middle of the band.
