##### ***Crystals***
- ==They formed by ordered pattern of atoms, which extend in the space==.<br>==And so they are formed by a lattice, which is the same all through the macro-crystal==
- So the whole solid is made up of an ordered structure.
- ==The basic building block is called **crystal cell** (made up of few atoms)==, which is repeated through all the crystals, so we have a large structure, but if we cut this structure into pieces, we find always the same ordered pattern. <br>Then we have this solid here are very interesting for sensor because they have some special properties we will see.
- ==Moreover, usually. they are **anisotropic**, which means that the response of the material depends on the direction of application of the excitation. <br>So if I stretch, if I apply a force that the deformation will depend on the direction of application of the force. <br>So the response of the material depends on the input quantity direction==.
- ==Usually crystals are very **resistant to high temperature**==.

##### ***Polycrystals***
- ==Solids, which are composed by many single crystals==, which are very small, and so this order is maintained in some small domains.<br>==Also each crystal domain has a **random orientation**==.
- ==These domains are put one close to the other, divided by the so called **grain boundaries**==.
- ==So the overall structure, unless you do some special operations is usually **isotropic**==.

##### ***Glasses***
- ==Have a short range order, not long range like crystals==. 

---
***Polymers***
- ==They are long chains of smaller organic molecules called **monomers** (*~ex of a polymer.: plastic*)==. 
- Usually they are artificial materials and they have many interesting properties for sensors.
- ==The property of polymers depend on the type of **monomer**, which is the smaller organic molecule, which is repeated along the chain==.<br>So it depends on the type of monomer that is used.<br>But also on how these monomers link together, in order to get the overall *chain*, which is the **polymer**, called the "**chain type**".
- The reason why they are very used and interesting for sensors is that they can be prepared with low cost preparation routes and processes.<br>==Polymers are usually **low cost materials** based on **carbon** and hydrocarbon usually==.<br>==The main problem with this kind of structure is the **temperature operation range**, it is limited being this an organic material==.<br>However, there are few polymers which resist to high temperatures.
