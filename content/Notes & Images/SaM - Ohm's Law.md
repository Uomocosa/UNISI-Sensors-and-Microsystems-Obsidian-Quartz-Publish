==So $\sigma$ is conductivity==.<br>==And $\mu$ and is the mobility==. 

The conductivity is defined as: $$\sigma_n = \frac{n q^2 \tau}{m_e^*}$$
The mobility is defined as: $$\mu_n = \frac{q \tau}{m_e^*}$$
The relationship between conductivity and mobility is: $$\sigma_n = n q \mu_n$$
Also the unit of measure of the two are:
- Conductivity: $[\sigma_n] = \frac{\mho}{\text{m}}$
- Mobility: $[\mu_n] = \frac{\text{m}^2}{\text{V} \cdot \text{s}}$
***
Conductivity and Resisitivty are reciprocal:$$\rho = \frac{1}{\sigma}$$
***
We have defined the transport current (assuming $\nabla \cdot n = 0$) as $$\vec J_n = \sigma_n \vec E$$This is also the definiton of the ***Ohm's Law***.
***
We need to make a distintion:
1. For **metals**, we only care about electrons, so we can approximate this formula as we just saw:$$\vec J_n = \sigma_n \vec E$$
2. For **semiconductors** instead, we also need to account for the holes:$$\vec J_n = \sigma_n \vec E + \sigma_p\vec E$$
