So in general there are many different devices which are based on **variable transformer** that can be used to measure the **position**, the **displacement** or the **angle**.

- The philosophy behind is always the same:
	- We have a **fixed primary**, and the **moveable secondary circuit**. 
	- The sensing is based on the variation of the **mutual induction**.
	- Moving the second circuit we create a measurable change of the mutual induction.

> Rember that the formula we have defined for transformers is: 
> *A transformer with mutual inductance $M$ and two currents $i_1$ and $i_2$ flowing trough its two "branches", then we will have the two voltage drops equal to (in the frequency domain)*:$$\begin{align}&V_1 = j\kern2px \omega \kern1px M \kern1px i_2\\&V_2 = j\kern2px \omega \kern1px M \kern1px i_1\end{align}$$
