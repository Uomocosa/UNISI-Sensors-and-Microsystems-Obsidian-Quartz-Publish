- In particular, since silicon is an atom of the **fourth group**, so it has 4 valence electrons.
- We can put inside silicon in place of some silicon atom either **third group element** or **fifth group element**.<br>So we can **dope it** with either **third group element** or **fifth group element**.
- So in case of addition of empty state, it is used the term **acceptor** (or **$p$-type doping**), so an acceptor state is an empty state ready to take an electron. 
- Instead an occupied state is a **donor** state (or **$n$-type doping**), so it's a state which is ready to give an electron to donate an electron.

##### ~Ex.: Doped Silicon at $0째\ \text{K}$
Let's see how doped Silicon behaves at different temperatures, at $0째K$:
![[Pasted image 20230710173050.png]]
- The Fermi Energy changes a lot, with respect to intrinsic Silicon.
- We can model the doping (donor or accepetor) with an added energy level, or **extrinsinc band**, near the valence (for **p-type**) or conductance band (for **n-type**).<br>The difference between the new energy level added with doping and the "closest" band is in the order of $\sim \text{meV}$, **very small**.
- **n-type** doped Silicon will have an **increase** to the value of its Fermi Enerrgy (since it has more electrons).
- **p-type** doped Silicon will have a **decrese** to the value of its Fermi Enerrgy (since it has more holes).

*What happens at $300 째K$?*

- Since this is a very small energy jump, the electrons have enough energy from/to the **extrinsic band** (depending on the doping type).
- Doping means add a small number of defect, to alter (not compleately change) the lattice of a regular material, ==we usually add $\sim 10^{15} \ \text{cm}^{-3} \div 10^{18} \ \text{cm}^{-3}$ "density of dopants" to dope a material==.
- So the creation of free charge is due to two factors:
  1. The **intrinsic** jump that could happen, the same as in **intrinsic Silicon**.<br>There are a not much, but because you need a larger jump and so a larger energy.<br>So **it's less probable**.
  2. And then we have the ionization of the impurities, of the dopants.<br>In case of acceptor, this ionization creates a negative ion, instead in case of donors, the ionization creates a positive ion because the donors lose their electron. 
- So given these two factors we define a rule known as **Electro-Neutrality**:$$p+N_D^{+}=n+N_A^{-}$$Where:
	- $p$ : density of "free holes".
	- $n$ : density of "free electrons".
	- $N_D^{+}$: density of "ionazied" donors.
	- $N_A^{-}$: density of "ionazied" acceptors.
	- **NOTE**: The ionazied term means the dopants that contribuite to conduction, so the "active" dopants.<br>*~Ex.: in case of donors the electron that from the "donors extrinsix band" ($E_D$) have gone to the condution band*.<br>*~Ex.: And n case of acceptors the holes that from the "acceptor extrinsix band" ($E_A$) have gone to the valance band*.
