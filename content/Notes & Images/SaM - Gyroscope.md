> - It uses the principle of the **Coriolios acceleration**, to relate an angular velocity to an acceleration, the formula is:$$\vec a = -2\vec \Omega \times \vec v$$We can measure this acceleration like we do for the accelerometer, using [[SaM - Metal Strain Gauge • Passive Strain Sensor|strain gauges]], instead of simple springs.

If we rotate a piece of metal moving at velocity $\vec v_x$ (or in this case it will oscillate at this velocity) with an angular momentum $\vec \Omega_z = {\vec{\dot \theta}_z}$, than this piece of metal will experience an acceleration equal to:$$\vec a = -2\vec \Omega \times \vec v$$
So if they are perpendicular, as in this case:$$a_y = -2\kern2px \Omega_z \kern1px  v_x$$
Then suppose this metal object is fixed with a spring $K$, so:
