We take into account a **plane wave**, which propagates along $x_1$.

- ***What is a Planar Wave?***
	- A planar wave, also known as a plane wave, is a type of electromagnetic or acoustic wave characterized by the property that the wavefronts, which are surfaces of constant phase, are flat and planar.<br>In other words, a plane wave's wavefronts are parallel planes, and the wave propagates uniformly in a single direction without spreading out as it travels.
- ***What is a Planar Wave?*** (Professor's Explenation)
	- All the variables which describes the waves are constant on plates perpendicular to $x_1$. 
- So the Hooke's formula is much more compact, since we have to evalutated only for $j = l = 1$, where $j$ and $l$ are referning tho this part: $\frac{\partial^2 u_k}{\partial x_j \partial x_l}$ and using the symmetry of $C$, we end up with only 3 formulas (that are not equal to $0$).
- Remeber to not look, or try to make sense of the indecies for the compressed notation for $c$, since for example $c_{44}$ does not refer to 4th dimension.
- **NOTE**: In the first formula we use $c_{11}$ and in the other two we use $c_{44}$ this is because
