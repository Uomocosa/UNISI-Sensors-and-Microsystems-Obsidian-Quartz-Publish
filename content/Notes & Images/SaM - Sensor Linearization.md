**The ideal sensor is linear** â‡’ To linearize a sensor we can use:
- [[SaM - End Point  Linear Approximation & Linear Regression|End Point  Linear Approximation & Linear Regression]] 
- Or [[SaM - Linearized Sensors for a Small Range|Linearized Sensors for a Small Range]]

So we consider the ideal linear sensor as:
- **Static Behavior**: $$e = \alpha g + k$$
- **Dynamic Behavior** (with infinite speed because ideal): $$e(t) = \alpha g(t) + k$$
