==The first one is the dependence of the material properties on $g$. 
So the sensor is realized, exploiting some effect, which changes one properties, one electrical properties due to the effect of a variation of $g$==. 

==The other operation mechanism of sensor is the dependence of the geometry of the sensor on $g$, so let's think about a resistance, we have said that by stretching the conductor, so changing his length and his cross area, we have a variation of resistance.
So this can be a working principle for sensors==. 

==Finally, as a separate kind of working principle, we can exploit electromagnetic coupling of the sensor we want with the environment, with $g$==. 


We will see 3 different accelerometer each with a different kind of operational principle:
1. Using the **material properties**: "***Charge Accelerometer***" (Piezoelectric).
2. Using the **dependency on the geometry**: "***Capacitive Accelerometer***".
3. Using the **electromagnetic coupling**: "***Magnetic Accelerometer***".
