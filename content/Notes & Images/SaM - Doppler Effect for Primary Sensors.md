##### ***Remeber***:

> The recived frequency of the transmitted signal is changed by a factor of$$f_0' = f_0 \left(1 - f_D\right)$$Where $f_D$ (called the "***doppler shift***") depends on the angle and speed of the flowing liquid, like so:$$f_D = {2 v \cos \theta \over c}$$And:
> - $c \simeq 3 \cdot 10^8 {\text{m} \over \text{s}}$ speed of light
