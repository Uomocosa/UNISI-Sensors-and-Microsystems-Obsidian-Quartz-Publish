- So let's think of a **cylinder made of conductive material**, which is **filled by liquid**.
- This is a **non-ionic liquid, so it's like an insulator**.<br>[Ionic liquids have negligible conductivities](https://www.britannica.com/science/nonionic-liquid#:~:text=have%20negligible%20conductivities).
- Inside of which we place a **conductive rod**.
- We have:
	- $h$ : height of the liquid.
	- $L$ or $l$ : height of the cylinder.
	- $a$ : small area of the rod.
	- $b$ : radius of the cylinder
	- $\varepsilon$ : permittivity of the liquid (different permittivity with respect to vacume)
	- $\varepsilon_0$ : permittivity of vacume
- So it's like having one capacitance $C_1$ and one other capacitance $C_2$, and these two capacitance are put in parallel.

Instead if we have to measure an ionic liquid, so that conducts, we can:
