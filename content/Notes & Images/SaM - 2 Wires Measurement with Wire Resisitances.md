What happens if we were to consider the **wire resistances** $R_{{\small W1}}$ and $R_{{\small W2}}$ attached to the sensor, with a [[SaM - Voltage Supply vs. Current Supply|current supply]]:
![[Lecture 9_230926_222449_4 2.jpg|500]]
So we would measure not just the resitance value of our sensor $\left[ R(T) \right]$ but instead we would get:$$R_{\small{\text{MEASURED}}} = R(T) + R_{{\small W1}} + R_{{\small W2}}$$
Also note that usually the reisistance of the cables will also change due to temperature, this results into a **variable offset**, not good.
To solve this problem we can use a [[SaM - 4 Wires Measurement with Wire Resisitances|4 wire measurement system]].
