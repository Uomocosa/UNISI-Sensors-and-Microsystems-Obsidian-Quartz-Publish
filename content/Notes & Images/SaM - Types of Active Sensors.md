In **active sensor** we have voltage generation, or better things which resemble voltage generators, which are:
- **electrochemical** (for chemical compound).
- **electromagnetic** (this is for speed, essentially).
- **thermoelectric** (for temperature).
- **charge generator**, this have high internal impedance, to connect to what we have seen some less than ago, and this can be further divided in:
    - **piezoelectric** (for strain and stress).
    - **electrochemical** (for chemical compound), this is a chemical and chemical sensor. It sends some specific compound obviously not all.
    - **optoelectronic**, this uses the optical power.
