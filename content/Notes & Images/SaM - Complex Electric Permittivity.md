##### What is the Complex Electric Permittivity?
- Complex permittivity can be represented as follows:$$\hat\varepsilon = \varepsilon' - j\varepsilon''$$Where:
	- $\varepsilon'$ is the real part of the permittivity, representing the **dielectric constant**.
	- $\varepsilon''$ is the imaginary part of the permittivity, representing the **dielectric loss or conductivity**.
- The real part ($\varepsilon'$), reflects the material's ability to store electrical energy in an electric field (similar to the dielectric constant).<br>==It's associated with the capacitive response of the material==.
- The imaginary part ($\varepsilon''$) , is related to the energy dissipation in the material due to electrical losses (usually in the form of heat) when an alternating electric field is applied. <br>==This component accounts for the conductive properties of the material==.

> #NOT_SURE_ABOUT_THIS (*This is probabally wrong, since the complex permettivity is a higly non-linar function depending on the frequency $\omega$*)
> - *~Ex.: Water: $\varepsilon' = 78.5$, $\varepsilon'' = 2.25$ ⇒ ${\varepsilon'' \over \varepsilon'} \gg 1$*.
> 	- *So it's a **good conductor**, but a **poor dielectric** (**elettro-magnetic waves**do not propagate well)*.
> - *~Ex.: Vacum: $\varepsilon' = 1$, $\varepsilon'' = 0$ ⇒ ${\varepsilon'' \over \varepsilon'} = 0$*.
> 	- _So it's a **perfect dielectric**, **E.M. waves** do not attenuate, but does not conduct electricity, at all_.
