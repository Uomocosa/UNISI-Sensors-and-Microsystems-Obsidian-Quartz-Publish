- Thermistor are made of a thick layer of Ceramic (semiconductor).
- They are very used, and cost less than RTD.
- For this material here we have we exploit the semi-conductive behavior of this material which gives us a **thermally activated conduction**. 
- Something operating in the freeze out or in the intrinsic, the carriers has to be freed by the temperature, so there is a conduction which is related with an exponential function with temperature. 
- And obviously we expect resistances which decreases with temperature, because the higher is the temperature the larger is the number of carriers that becomes available or that can overcome a barrier in any case.
