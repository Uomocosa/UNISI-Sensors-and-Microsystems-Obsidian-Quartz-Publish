- Here you can see the very complex circuit which is used to drive this kind of transducer.

**Ultrasonic probe gave it very large flexibility**.

Usually they are 1D arrays, but sometimes that could also be 2-D arrays where a matrix is formed by these elements.

==The problem is the **complexity**==, both for **1D** and **2D** arrays.

Because you have so many wires, so many different signals that have to be generated and to be used processed at the moment of receiving the signal that this technology is difficult to be used.
