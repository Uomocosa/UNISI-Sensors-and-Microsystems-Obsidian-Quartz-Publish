#IMPORTANTE 
So here's a table which shows you the three different piezocoefficients in the crystallographic axis for $n$-type piezoresistors or $p$-type piezoresistors, which have a doping level which gives this value of the base resistivity:<br>![[Pasted image 20230611121743.png]]
- $p_e$ is the fixed value of the doping level (or *concentration of dopants*)
- And you can find here values which are very different for both the two materials, both in value and in sign. 
- So actually you can explore this kind of technology to have either **positive sensitivity** or **negative sensitivity**. 
- So by selecting the doping type, the orientation, you can have strain gauges with opposite sensitivity. 
- And this will simplify sometimes differential measurement. 
- So this is a "*freedom degree*" for designing these kind of devices.
