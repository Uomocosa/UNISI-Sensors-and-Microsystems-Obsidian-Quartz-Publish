- Let's define the ratio between the applied pressure (**uniaxial [[SaM - Definition of Stress and Strain • Definition of Strain and Stress • Stress Vector • Strain Vector|stress]]**) and deformation (or [[SaM - Definition of Stress and Strain • Definition of Strain and Stress • Stress Vector • Strain Vector|strain]], this ratio is called the "***Young modulus***".<br>==For [[SaM - Definition of Isotropic and Anisotropic Materials|isotropic materials]], the **Young modulus** is independent on the direction of application of the force==.
- Then I also define the "***Poisson module***", which represents the ratio between the **perpendicular strain** (with respect to the applied force) and the **parallel strain**. <br>==Again for **isotropic materials**, this is a number and doesn't depend on the direction of application of the force.==

##### In Higher Dimensions
If we go to higher dimensions, if we use **uniaxial stress**, it does not change at all:

- $\left[\sigma_1,\ \ldots ,\ 0\right]$ is the [[SaM - Definition of Stress and Strain • Definition of Strain and Stress • Stress Vector • Strain Vector|stress]] vector.

> #IMPORTANTE 
> Otherwise, for higher dimensions we need to use the "[[SaM - Hooke's Law • Collapsed Yieldness Tensor for Isotropic Materials|Hooke's law]]".
