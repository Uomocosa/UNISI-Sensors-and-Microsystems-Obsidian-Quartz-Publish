An [[SaM - Operational Amplifier|operational amplifier]] and more specifically a [[SaM - Differential Amplifier|differential amplifier]] have two inputs.

When we see a single input amplifier, like this:<br>![[Pasted image 20240116233210.png]]
- The input and output voltage connections are shown as single conductors, because ==it is assumed that all signal voltages are referenced to a common connection in the circuit (**ground**)==.

This is the same circuit as a two-inputs amplifier<br>![[Pasted image 20240116233538.png]]
- The amplifier in the figure can be any two-inputs amplifier, for example an [[SaM - Operational Amplifier|operational amplifier]].
