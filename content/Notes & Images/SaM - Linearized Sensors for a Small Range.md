Even if the sensor is **not linear**, if we operate in a **small range**, we can refer to the **linearization** of the sensor itself:

I will describe the relation between $e$ and $g$ as:

- So I can, in any case, have a general validity of what I will say afterwards, taking in an account, linearized, $f$. 
- So either:<br>The sensor it is linear.<br>Or I take into account all the operation around a small working point, so from now on, I think to a **linear system**.
