The ***Pauli Principle*** states that: ==*two Identical particles can't occupy the same energy level simultaneusly*==.

Here we can see a graphical representation, where we take $N$ individual particles and "group" them toghter in a unic solid, while we move them closer togheter we can see the **energy levels** forming.<br>At the end when they are compleately groupped we will have $N$ levels, due to the pauli principle:

- Take into account that usually the **density of atoms** in a solid formed by pure Silicon (so no other atoms are present in this particular solid), is $10^{22} \, \text{cm}^{-3}$.
- ==So the ***Pauli principle*** tells us that two identical particles can't occupy the same energy level or quantum state simultaneously==. 
- If we form a solid, we put together and make a very large number of atoms interact with each other, the number of atoms which are bound together is so large that, due to the **Pauli Principle**, we will have so many different energy levels, (so due to the fact that they cannot be two identical levels in the same system), ==and these different energy levels are so close, dense and numerous that they can be considered as a continuum or a continuous interval of admitted levels, and these are called **band**==.
