We have thought a lot we have spoken about ultrasonic plane waves, so we have considered all the fields constant, all these planes which are perpendicular to the direction of propagation of the wave.
But when we generate an ultrasonic wave with a transducer, we have a source which has a **finite area**.

So a **plane wave** can be thought to be generated by **an infinite surface vibrating**, or by a surface which is at an infinite distance from the spot of observation

If instead we consider to have a finite area source, the front waves have different geometry.

*~Ex.: Point surface*:

Let's go to more real case, a transducer which can be considered as a **plane piston**.
*~Ex.: Transducer which is a Plane Piston Circular*:

- You have a strange shape of the wave front, **inside the ciliinfer** it can be considered approximately **planar**, this particular "part" of wavefront is called the "***Frensel Region***" or "**Near Field**", and sometimes we say that in this part "the beam is not yet formed"
- Outside the cilinder instead we have a "**Far Field Region**", behaving like a spherical wavefront.

If I find two obstacles with the "far region field", both are seen by the probe and they appear as to be only one obstical, so **they can't be distinguished**:
![[Pasted image 20230720162635.png]]Instead if you have an object in front and an object outside covered by the first one, then only moving the probe you can see this second obstacle, again not easy to distinguish them
