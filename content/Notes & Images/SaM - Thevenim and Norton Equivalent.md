==And obviously, the most simple choice is to use the **Thevenim** or **Northon equivalent**, which you can use for **any type of two terminal linear network**==.

==So in case $Z_{TH}=Z_N$ is very large, better to use this Norton equivalent, understand that the sensor will be better described by a current generator and not with a voltage generator, and best thing is trying to amplify a current instead of amplifying a voltage==.

Here's an example on how to find the Thevenim Equivalent:
1. Disconnect A-B ("the **load**").
2. Find the voltage $V_{TH}$.
3. Reconect the load, disconnect all **indipendent sources**, and calculate the **Thevenim resistance** ($R_{TH}$) between A and B.
