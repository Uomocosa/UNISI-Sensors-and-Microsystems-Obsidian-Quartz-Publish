- ***What are Surface Defects and Grain Boundary Barriers***:
	- *Surface Defects are imperfections or irregularities that exist on the surface of a material*.
	- *Due to this Surface Defects, in a non-uniform material (or more specifically a crystal) Grain Boundaries are formed*.
	- *Grain Boundaries are interfaces that separate different crystalline regions or grains within a material*.<br>*When a material is not a continuous crystal but consists of many small crystals or grains, the grain boundaries are where these grains meet.*
	- ***Grain Boundaries can act as barriers to various processes and properties in materials***.

==**You always have surface defects**==.

- ==You can represent a surface defect as a difference in energy levels==, here you can see a normal intrinsic silicon represented by $E_C$ and $E_V$ and attached to it an imperfection in the extrinsic silicon, it is represetned as a [[SaM - Doping of Silicon|doped silicon]] with $E_A$ and $E_D$ the *acceptor energy level* and *donor energy level*.
- If we have a surplus or fewer electrons due to the imperfection, an electron will be given/taken from the intrinsic silicon, resulting in the creation of a small localized electric charge.
- ==If the donor level loses the electron, or if they acceptor take the electrons, you have some localized charge at the surface==. 

The localized charge gives form to an electric field:

- ==The resulting behaviour will be somenting similar to a diode==.
