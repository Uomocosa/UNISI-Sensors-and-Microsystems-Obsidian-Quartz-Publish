##### ***Remeber***:

> ==Heat Convection is defined by the ***motion of matter***==.
> The formula for the **thermal resistance** when we talk about heat convection is:$$R_{TH}=\frac{1}{h\cdot A}$$Where:
> - $A$ is the ***area***.
> - $h$ is the ***convective heat transfer coefficient***, it is similar to the [[SaM - Heat Conduction • Thermal Resistance|thermal conductivity]] but it does **not** depend on space, its unit of measure is: $\left[{\text{W} \over \text{°K}}\right]$

- ==There is an error in the measurment units, it should be==:
	- $[\dot q] = \frac{W}{m^2}$
	- $[h] = \frac{W}{m^2\cdot °K}$
