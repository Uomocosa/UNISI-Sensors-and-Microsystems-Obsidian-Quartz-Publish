- In this example we see a **mass-spring-dumper system** composed of $m,\ k,\ \lambda$ attach to a sensor of mass $m_S$.
- We measure via the sensor the quantities $k_S,\ \lambda_S$.
- So in this basic example we have:
	- $Z$ : *unknown real impedance*.
	- $Z_S$ : *measured impeadance*.
- If we wish to find $F$, which is the **effort quantity of the mechanical lumped parameter system** we need to use a sensor with a **high impedance** $Z_S$, ($Z_S$ acts as a **voltimeter**).
- If we wish to find one of the quantites $x,\ \dot x ,\ \ddot x$ derived from the **flow quantity of the mechanical lumped parameter system** ($\dot x$) we need to use a sensor with a **low impedance** $Z_S$, ($Z_S$ acts as a **ampometer**). #NOT_SURE_ABOUT_THIS *actually an ampometer would need to be put in parallel, so this is not a good example*.
- **Effort and flow quantities** of the **mechanical lumped parameter system**, where defined [[SaM - Lumped Parameter Systems|here]].
