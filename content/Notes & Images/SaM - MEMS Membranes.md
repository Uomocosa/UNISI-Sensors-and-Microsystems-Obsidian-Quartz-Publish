##### ***Remeber***:

> The structure of a [[SaM - Traditional Sensors vs. MEMS â€¢ MEMS Technology|MEMS]] membrane has this structure:<br>![[Pasted image 20230927113817 1.png|500]]
> - $\rho$ : distance from the center.
> - $D_z(\rho)$ : deflection with respect to the rest position $z_0$, given $\rho$.7
> - A MEMS membrane is a primary sensor that transforms a preassure into a deformation, following this formula:$$\overline D_z = {(3-\nu^2) \kern2px R^4 \over 16 \kern2px E \kern2px t^2} \Delta p$$We can simplify it like so:$$\overline D_z = \alpha \kern2px \Delta p$$Where: 
> 	- $\overline D_z$ is the **average** deflection across the whole membrane, and as a metter of fact for a circular membrane it follows this rule: $\overline D_z = {1 \over 3} D_z(0)$.
> 	- $\Delta p$ is the difference in preassure, under and above the membrane, $\Delta p = p_{\text{above}}-p_{\text{under}}$.
> 	- $E$ and $\nu$ are the [[SaM - Young and Poisson Modulus|Young and Poisson modulus]]
> 	- Note that it is a [[SaM - Ideal Linear Sensor|linear sensor]].
