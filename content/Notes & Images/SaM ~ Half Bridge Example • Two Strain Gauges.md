We mount two strain gauges sensors to a cantilever, attached to wall.
One strain gauge attached to the upper-face of the cantilever and one to the latter face, such that they will measure the same strain but with opposite sign.

Also they will have the same temperature, so they will have the **same DC offset** ($\alpha T$):

The "half-gridge output" obtained is:
