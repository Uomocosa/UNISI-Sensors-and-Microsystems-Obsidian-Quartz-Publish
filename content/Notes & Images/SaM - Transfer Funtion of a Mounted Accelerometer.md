##### ***Remeber***:

> - The transfer funtion of a [[SaM - Accelerometer|simple accelerometer]]:$${R(s) \over a(s)} = H(s) =  {{m_s \over K} \over {m_s \over K}s^2+{\lambda \over K}s+ 1}$$(*We suppose the mass of the accellerometer $(m_s)$ is much lower than the mass of the body $(m_b)$ that is attached to, so $m_s \ll m_b$*).

- So remember that for an accelerometer input is acceleration, output is the elongation of the string
