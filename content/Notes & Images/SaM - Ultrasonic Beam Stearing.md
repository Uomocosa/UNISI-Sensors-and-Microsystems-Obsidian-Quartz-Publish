Suppose to have an array of [[SaM - Ultrasonic Beams|beam tranducers]] as seen [[SaM - Control of an Ultrasonic Beam|previously]]:![[Pasted image 20230720162730.png]]
- If all these are excited with such an arrangement of time delays, the wave will propagate in the $x_1'$ direction which is tilted by an angle $\theta$ with respect to the plane of the transducer (having normal $x_1$).
