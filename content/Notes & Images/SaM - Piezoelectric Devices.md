- One is the [[SaM - Piezoelectric Accelerometer|accelerometer based on piezoelectric effect]].<br>We have already seen a type of accelerometer when we were discussing about MEMS device, which was the [[SaM - Capacitive Accelerometer|capacitive accelerometer]].
- [[SaM - Ultrasonic Transducers (Piezoelectric Device)|ultrasound transducers]].
- And finally, [[SaM - Quartz Oscillator|oscillator based sensor]].<br>And with special reference to the so-called QCM, which is quartz crystal micro-balance.
