> #IMPORTANTE 
> A voltage amplifier has this properties:
> - **Single pole (dominant pole) system**.
> - **DC-coupled**.<br>*It means that the amplifier is capable of amplifying signals with both DC (direct current) and AC (alternating current) components*.
> - **Very high input impedance, very low output impedance**.<br>While a [[SaM - Current Amplifier|current amplifer]] has low input resistance.
