In real world obviously we don't have this kind of infinite plane surface which separates it two media.

So the obstacle will have a surface surrounding it which has a certain geometry:

- So if the dimension (the size) of the obstacle, let's call the mean size $D$ is much larger than the wavelength $\lambda$, then we can speak about reflection in any case.

On the other hand if we have a small obstacle which is an obstacle with a dimension, with a size, comparable, similar to the wavelength, or the smaller than the wavelength, we don't have a reflected wave but we have a wave with an approximately **spherical wave front**.
And in this case we talk about **scattering**:

However thare could also happend (most cases) that our large surface is **not smooth**, in this case we talk about **diffues reflection**:

- $h$ : is a roughness measurement.
- We will have a reflection, which is called the "**diffuse reflection**" because each of these surface imperfections give rise to scattering.

##### Different type of Interaction between Waves and Media

- Obviously the amplitude of the vehicles are stronger depending on the **transmission coefficient** and **reflection coefficient**.
- Scattering is more difficult to work with since the wave is riflected in almost all directions instead of just one.
