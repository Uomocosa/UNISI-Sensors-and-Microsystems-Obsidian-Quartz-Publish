==If a [[SaM - Ultrasonic Waves|wave]] travels in a homogeneous medium, nothing happens==.
Instead when the wave encounters a **surface which separates an homogeneous medium and another homogeneous medium** (with different characteristics), then that could be a reflection.
Let's see how to quantify the phenomena of reflection:
![[Pasted image 20230720162047.png]]
- To do this, we have to introduce the **acoustic impedance**.
- So acoustic impedance is like a generalized impedance.
- The ***flow quantity*** (represented as a current) is the speed of the particles, which are vibrating and give the propagation of the wave.
- Whereas the ***effort quantity*** (represented as a voltage) is the **stress** ($T$), or in fluids the **pressure** ($P$).
- So the power ($P$) of the wave would be for us the product of this two quantity.

So we refer to this simple plane wave:
![[Pasted image 20230720162054.png]]
- So you will have uniform speed, preassure and stress.
- **NOTE**: $V_{1F}$ represents "how fast the wave changes form", the propagation speed is stille $v_l$.

So we can say, using ***Hooke's law***:
![[Pasted image 20230925184638.png]]
- We change the derivative since integating $T_{11}$ over time or space is similar, except it is scaled.

So the impedance is equal to:
![[Pasted image 20230925184942.png]]
- $\rho$ is the density as usual.
- So the impedance can be written in this two ways.
- $B = c_{11} = \frac{P}{\Delta V \over V}$ : Bulk modulus ($V$ in the formula is volume)

So suppose we have two materials represented by two different acustic impedances:
![[Pasted image 20230925185349.png]]
- Here you can see the phenomena of reflection, part of the wave bounces back, with a different propagation velocity ($v_r$)
- It is important that the propagation of the wave is perpendicular to the surface separating $Z_1$ and $Z_2$.
- $T_T$ : transmission coefficient for velocity; the ratio between the starting preassure and the pressure of the wave passed through $Z_2$.<br>(It's a pure number)
- $T_v$ : similar to $T_T$ is a ratio but this time between the propagation velocity.
- $\Gamma_v$ is the equivalent of $T_v$ but for the reflected wave, same for $\Gamma_T$ and $T_T$.

We define these coefficient, so that we can describe the "***transmitted***" and "***reflected***" part of the wave in terms of $v_i$ and $T_{11_{i}}$.
![[Pasted image 20230720162152.png]]
- $v$ in this formulas are proagation velocities.
- $\Gamma_v$ and $\Gamma_T$ : **reflection coefficients** for propagating velocity and stress (indicated by the pedicies $_v$ and $_T$, $\Gamma$ stands for "reflected".
- $T_v$ and $T_T$ : **transmitted coefficients** for propagating velocity and stress (indicated by the pedicies $_v$ and $_T$, the variable name $T$ stand for "transmitted"

We have considered many idealities (as always) and an **infinite plane**, completely smooth:

But I have a different incident angle, which means that I have this is the incident wave:
![[Pasted image 20230720162211.png]]
- So in this case here, if I call these angles: $\theta_1$, $\theta_2$, $\theta_3$.<br>We know that $\theta_1 = \theta_2$
- While:$$\frac{\sin \theta_3}{Z_2} = \frac{\sin \theta_1}{Z_1}$$
