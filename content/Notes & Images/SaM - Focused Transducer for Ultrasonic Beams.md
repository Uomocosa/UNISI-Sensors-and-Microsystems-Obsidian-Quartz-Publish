Obviously there are some possibility of improving the lateral resolution of [[SaM - Influence of the Source Geometry on the Ultrasonic Filed Shape-Type|plane piston circular transducers]], using **focused transducers**:

- In this case for instance we can take as an example a spherical ultrasonic transducers so we take a piece of a sphere this is the diameter $D$.
- $F$ is the **focal distance**.
