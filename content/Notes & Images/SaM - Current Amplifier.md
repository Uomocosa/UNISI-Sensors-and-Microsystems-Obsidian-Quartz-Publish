> **[[SaM - Operational Amplifier|Operational amplifier]]**:
> - $\large \beta =  {R_1 \over R_1 + R_2}$
> - $\large A = {A_{DC} \over 1 + j {{f \over f_H}}}$
> **[[SaM - Non-Inverting Operational Amplifier|Non inverting amplifier]]**: $\large V_0 = V_i \left(1 + {R_2 \over R_1}\right)$

> A current amplifier has this structure:<br>![[Pasted image 20240116232614.png]]
> The output is:$$V_{out} = R \cdot I_F$$And $I_F$ is:$$I_F = {Z_N \over {R \over A(f)} + Z_N}I_N$$If $A_{f}$ is really big, as it usually is for **DC signals**, we find that:$$I_F = I_N$$

> #IMPORTANTE 
> A current amplifier has this properties:
> - **Single pole (dominant pole) system**.
> - **DC-coupled**.<br>*It means that the amplifier is capable of amplifying signals with both DC (direct current) and AC (alternating current) components*.
> - **Very low input impedance, very low output impedance**.<br>While a [[SaM - Voltage Amplifier|voltage amplifer]] has high input resistance.
