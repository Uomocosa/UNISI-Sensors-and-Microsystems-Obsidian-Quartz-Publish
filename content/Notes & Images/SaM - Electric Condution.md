- Electric conduction is a motion of electron throughout the solid due to an external field.<br>This is possible if there are energy bands which are **partially occupied**. <br>==This means in other words that totally full or empty bands do not contribute to conduction==. 
- We will describe Electric Conduction using a semi-classic model.<br>So we will describe the **motion of electrons** using this formula here, where:
	- $\vec v$ is the speed of electron. 
	- $\dot{\vec{v}}$ is the derivative of the speed, so the acceleration. 
	- $m_e^*$ is a mass but is not the inertial mass is the **effective mass of the electron**.<br>Which takes into account the interaction of the moving electron, with other atoms which form the solid.<br>So $m_e^*$ describes how the solids influence the motion of the electron. 
	- $\vec F$ is the applied forces. 
- Depending on the direction of this force here, maybe $m_e^*$ has to be changed. <br>So pay attention because **this is not a constant nor scalar quantity, actually is more like a matrix**.
