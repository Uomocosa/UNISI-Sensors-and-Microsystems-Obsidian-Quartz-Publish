This thing here, the possibility of sensor can sometimes be compensated for with an operation, which is called **calibration**.

- I start by taking one, two, I don't know how many, let's say $k$ standards of the quantity $g$, the exact number $k$ depends on the shape of the function $f$.
- These standards must be know at-priori, for instance, let's think about temperature, If I take a melting ice cube, I know that it's temperature is $0°C$, and if I take water at the pressure of one atmosphere and I let it boil, I know that it's temperature is $100°C$.
- So calibration is finding this specific curve, which is called in this case **calibration curve**, by using standard of the quantity $g$ well known, performing a very accurate measurement of this value here, so that I can find two points of the function. 
- And if the function is linear obviously two points are enough.<br>Otherwise if the function is non-linear I need many others, the exaxct number of points depends on the shape. 
- So the calibration is intended to improve the knowledge with respect to the nominal one, to the one that the producer gave me, or if the producer doesn't provide me any information I need in this case to calibrate the device.
- *Remember the producer at most give us the average input-output function of the type of sensor, not the specifc one, which is what we are searching for*.
