##### Covalent
- Sharting of the outer electrons between atoms.
- This bonds are presents in: **Crystals with low thermal and electrical conductivity**.
- And Solids formed by this bonds have:
	- **Low thermal and electrical conductivity**.
	- **High mechanical strenght**.
	- But are **brittle**.

---
##### Ionic
- Like covaelnt bond, we have the shearing of an electron, however this time the electron is **given** by one atom to the other.
- One class of **ionic solids** which is very important for sensor is the **metal oxides**. 
- Solids formed by this bonds have:
	- **Low thermal and electrical conductivity**.
	- **Large mechanical strenght**. (lower than covaelnt solids).
	- But are **brittle**.
---
##### Metallic
- All the outer electrons of the atoms in the solid are sheared.
- Solids formed by this bonds have:
	- **High thermal and electrical conductivity**.
	- **Good mechanical properties and strength**.
	- And are **ductile** materials.

---
##### Van-Der-Walls 
- Weak bonds.
