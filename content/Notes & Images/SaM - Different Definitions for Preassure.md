- **differential pressure** (so the difference between two pressures)
- **absolute pressure**, so it's like taking $p_1$ as $0$ pascal
- **gauge pressure**, which is a differential pressure where **$p_1$ is $1$ atmosphere**

- There are many different applications and solutions for primary sensors for pressure, and they depend essentially on the **range** (preassure ranges) can be very different

- The unit for pressure that should be used is **Pascal**.
- Actually also **Atmosphere** is used: **one atmosphere is a little more than 100 kilopascal**.
- It is also used **bar**, a **bar is exactly 100 kilopascal**.
- **PSI** which is **pound per square inch**, which corresponds to $6.89 \cdot 10^3 Pa$.
