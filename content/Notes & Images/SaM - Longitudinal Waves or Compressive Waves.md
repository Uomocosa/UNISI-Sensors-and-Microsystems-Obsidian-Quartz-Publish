If the displacement of the particles are parallel to the propagation of the wave, then it is called a **longitudinal wave**, and we can write it in the collapsed notation:
![[Pasted image 20230719131609.png]]
- So the collapsed notation takes $j=k=l$, so the condition for a **longitudial wave**, and writes it as a single index.
- **NOTE**: The complete extended notation would be $$\rho \ddot u_j = \sum_i c_{ij} \frac{\partial^2 u_j}{\partial^2 x_j}$$ #NOT_SURE_ABOUT_THIS 
- So this means that you have a wave, which travels/propagates along $x_1$ and all the particles are displaced along this direction. 
- So these are **longitudinal waves** or **compressive waves** or **waves of pressure** because what changes is a pressure because you have molecules which pushes other on contact.
- And this kind of wave can propagate through **solid** and **liquids** and fluids in general (air is considered a fluid).
- Remeber to not look, or try to make sense of the indecies for the compressed notation for $c$, since for example $c_{44}$ does not refer to 4th dimension
- ***What is a Longitudinal Wave?*** (ChatGPT):
	-  A longitudinal wave is a type of mechanical wave in which the particles of the medium vibrate back and forth in the direction parallel to the direction of energy transfer.
	- This is in contrast to transverse waves, where the particles of the medium move perpendicular to the direction of energy transfer
