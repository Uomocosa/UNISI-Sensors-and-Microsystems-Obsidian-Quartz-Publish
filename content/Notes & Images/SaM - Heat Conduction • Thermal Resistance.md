##### ***Remeber***:

> ==Heat Conduction is defined by the tranfer of heat ***without the motion of matter***==.
> The formula for the **thermal resistance** when we talk about heat conduction is:$$R_{TH}=\frac{t}{k\cdot A}$$Where:
> - $t$ is the **thickness**.
> - $A$ is the ***area***.
> - $k$ is the ***thermal conductivity***, it is similar to the [[SaM - Heat Convection • Thermal Resistance|convective heat transfer coefficient]] but it **does** depend on space, its unit of measure is: $\left[{\text{W} \over \text{°K}\cdot \text{m}}\right]$

- There is an error, the unit measure of $k$ is $\frac{W}{m^2 \cdot °K}$
