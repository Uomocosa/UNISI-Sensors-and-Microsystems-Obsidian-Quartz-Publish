*Why the idea sensor is linear?* 
- Because obviously for a linear domain, for linear sensor **we have simplicity**, simplicity because the sensitivity is constant:<br>![[Pasted image 20230624105738.png]]

***The Linar Sensor***:

- If the sensor is **ideal also from the dynamical point of view**, an ideal sensor should have an **infinite speed**.<br>Therefore this should be true, also for dynamic measurement. 
- So in this case, I will have that the sensor output can follow the change of the input without distortion.
- So the output will be a perfect copy of the input multiplied by this quantity here, which is the sensitivity ($b_0 = \alpha$).
- So in this case, I will have **the ideal situation**:<br>The output changes immediately, and the shape of the output is exactly the same as the shape of the input. 
- **NOTE**: This is a zero order system, more specifiacally a **zero order linear system**.<br>==**No real system behaves as a zero order linear system**==, all systems have a **limited adaptation speed**, so they can follow the output but with a certain distortion, and a certain **delay**.
