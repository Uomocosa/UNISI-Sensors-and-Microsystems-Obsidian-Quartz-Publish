- $\text{RH}$ : humidity level.
- The [[SaM - Electric Permittivity • Electric Susceptibility • Electric Field|dielectric (or electric) permittivity]] $(\varepsilon)$ is a function of **humidity** $(\text{RH})$.
- The **relative humidity of water** $@ 25°\text{C}$ is approximately $\varepsilon_{r_{\text{H}_2\text{O}}}\approx80$.
- So the capacitance will be equal to: $$C = {A \over d}\varepsilon(\text{RH})$$And if we use some common real world values we obtain a variation of capacitance:$${\Delta C \over C} = 1.7 \ {\text{pF} \over \text{RH\%}}$$Where: $\text{RH\%}$ is "**humidity percentage**".
- And a typical value we find of $C$ is:$$375 \ \text{pF} + 1.7 \ {\text{pF} \over \text{RH\%}}\cdot  \text{RH\%}$$So we dont actually have the problem of a small capacitance, this is a **measurable capacitance**, it's big enough.
