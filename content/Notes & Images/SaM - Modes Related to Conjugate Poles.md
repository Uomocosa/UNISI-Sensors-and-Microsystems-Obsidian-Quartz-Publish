So in this case here you have a couple $p_{i1}$ and $p_{i2}$:<br>![[Pasted image 20230624212733.png]]

==This kind of poles corresponds to modes of the response of this type here: **a damped sine wave**==:<br>![[Pasted image 20230624212849.png]]

**speed of decay $\tau_i$**:

**angular frequency $\omega_0$**:

**damping coefficient $\zeta$**:

- In blu a curve with a smaller demping coefficient with respect to the red curve, with a higher $\zeta$.
