==So let's say we input a sine wave with frequency really small, with respect to $f_T$, so when $|H(f)| \simeq A_{DC}$==:

- So if the module **does not** depend on frequency.
- And if its pahse is $0$, or it could be even allowed a linear phase.<br>(Why the linear phase is allowed ??? #NOT_SURE_ABOUT_THIS )
