*Sensor = Primary Sensor + Real Sensor*
The typical structure of a device is: ***Sensor*** ⇒ ***Front-End Electronics*** ⇒ ***A/D Converter***

- ==_A primary sensor transform a non-electrical quantity into another (more "convinent") non-electrical quantity_==.
- ==_A sensor (or in this case called "real sensor") instead, transforms a non-electrical quantity into an **electrical quantity**_==.

- Convenient quantitites for this output port of the primary sensor are **displacement**, **strain** and **stress**.
- This is because we know that each of these quantities here can be easily sensed by means of **resistive**, **capacitive** or **piezoelectric** sensors.
- Another convenient quantity is **temperature** because in this case we can use **thermoelectric effect**, we can exploit capacitive or better resistive sensors.
- It can be also a **velocity**, or speed, because in this case we can exploit **electromagnetic effects** to have a sensor.
