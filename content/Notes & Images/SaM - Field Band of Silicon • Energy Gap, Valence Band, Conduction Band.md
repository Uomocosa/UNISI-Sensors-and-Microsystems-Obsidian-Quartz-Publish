##### ***Remeber***:

> - Pure Silicon (*Si*) has $4$ electrons not belonging to a completed "shell", so they can interact with each other.<br>Also to complete the outher shell a *Silicon* atom would need other $4$ electrons.
> - If we study how these electrons interact, if we change the distance between the atoms, at $0°\text{K}$, we can see the forming of two "**bands**":<br>![[Pasted image 20230710172546 1.png|400]]
> 	- Each band contains $4N$ energy levels.<br>Where $N$ is number of particles in the system.<br>==*If we were to take into consideration only $1$ atom (of Silicon), than $N=1$*==.
> 	- Also the lower energy band is compleately filled, while the higher energy band is compleately empty.
> - From this we can define:
> 	- ==The **valence band** is the highest energy occupied band==.
> 	- ==The **conduction band** is the lowest energy un-occupied band==. 
> 	- ==The **band gap** between valence band and conduction band where there are no allowed energy states==, for pure *Silicon* at $0°\text{K}$ this is about $\simeq 1.2 \,\text{eV}$.
> - Both the band gap and the probability of finding an electron in the **conduction band** change with temperature (see [[SaM - Dependence of the Fermi Energy on Temperature|dependence of the fermi energy on temperature]]).<br>For example at $200 °\text{K}$ the energy gap of Silicon is sligtly differnt: $E_{g_{Si}} = 1.1 \,\text{eV}$.

- So we have these ($1s$, $2s$, $2p$, $3s$, $3p$) are the levels that form silicon. 
- And the lowest energy level are: $1s$, $2s$, $2p$
- So we have:
	- $1s$: two electrons.
	- $2s$: two electrons.
	- $2p$: six electrons
- All of these are **not interacting with other atoms**.
- Instead the orbitals and the electrons which are involved in interaction are:
	- $3s$: two electrons
	- $3p$: two electrons.
- So the $3p$ is a **partially filled energy orbital**, and these are the electrons responsible for interaction, and are the so called **bond electrons**.
- In the graph we have:
	- $d$: distance between atoms.
	- $d^*$: the right distance for the creation of the crystal, so for silicon this "crystal spacing" is about $500$ picometer.
	- $E$: energy.
	- $N$: number of particles in the system.<br>All $3s$ orbital can contain up to $2N$ electron.<br>All $3p$ orbital can contain up to $6N$ electron.<br>The same is true for the other orbitals in the whole system, or solid.<br>==If we take into consideration only $1$ atom (of Silicon), than $N=1$==.
- ==**NOTE**: we assume to be workiung at $0°K$==.
- So at infinite distance ($d$), I have this energy for the $3p$ level orbital and this energy for the $3s$ orbital, we don't care about the specifics.<br>Also I have both the $3s$ and in the $3p$ orbital contains $2N$ electrons, where $3s$ is completely filled, $3p$ is partially empty.
- When I start moving the atoms and bringing them closer, i see that energy bands start forming.<br>We end up with a total of $8N$ energy lelvels.<br>So two bands (valence and conduction band) which span a total of $8N$ energy levels.<br>But with only $4N$ electrons (these are the **bond electrons**) that fills them.
- At $0°K$ all **bond electrons** are found in the **Valence Band**.<br>If we were to increase the temperature than some electron would move from the **Valence Band** to the **Conduction Band**.

These are the definitions of the different bands and gap:
![[Pasted image 20230710172601.png]]
- ==The **valence band** is the highest energy occupied band==. 
- ==The **conduction band** is the lowest energy un-occupied band==. 
- ==The **band gap** between valence band and conduction band where there are no allowed energy states==.

- Same as before, but a more accurate graph.
