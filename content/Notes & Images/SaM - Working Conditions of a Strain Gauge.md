##### ***Remeber***: 

> When working with a **strain gauge** we need to look out for a couple of things:

> 2. Check the **Bonding with the Substrate**.<br>This check is necessary only for [[SaM - Metal Strain Gauge • Passive Strain Sensor|Metal Strain Gauges]], or for devices which are physically different from the substrate (so from the object of which you want to measure the strain of). <br>So if they have a different backing, then you have to ensure bonding between the device (the strain gauge) and the substrate (the object I want to measure).

> 4. [[SaM - Self-Heating|Self-Heating]].<br>Since they are resistances, you need to power up this resistance to give some power to measure them, and so you cause self-heating.<br>Here's a table which shows you the difference between metal, constantant or platinum alloy, and piezo resistive devices based on silicon: #IMPORTANTE <br>![[Pasted image 20230611122502.png|666]]

- First of all we are operating in the **elastic regime** and this means that we can operate these sensors only in those situations in which you have actually a ==linear relationship between [[SaM - Definition of Stress and Strain • Definition of Strain and Stress • Stress Vector • Strain Vector|stress and strain]]==.<br>So you have a limitation, both in stress and in strain.
- For context, here's an image I found on the Internet<br>![[Pasted image 20231127121155.png|333]]<br>As said before if we work in the elastic regime, the realtionship between stress and strain is linear.

We have three things that we have to look at, which are:

Then we have to keep an eye on [[SaM - Self-Heating|self-heating]], because you know that since they are resistances, you need to power up this resistance to give some power to measure them, and so you cause self-heating.<br>And then here's a table which shows you the difference between metal, constantant or platinum alloy, and piezo resistive devices based on silicon:<br>![[Pasted image 20230611122502.png]]
