We have seen for instrinsic semiconductors the [[SaM - Instrinsic Semiconductor • Density of Carriers • Energy Gap and Carriers Dependance on Temperature#Instrinsic Mass Action Law|Instrinsic Mass Action Law]], the more general rule, is as follows:

> *In a **generic semiconducotor** it is always true that*: $$n\cdot p = n_i^2$$Or we can say:$$n = \frac{n_i^2}{p}$$

Where:
- $n$ : density of free electrons (in an **intrinsic** or **extrinsic** semicondutor).
- $p$ : density of free holes (in an **intrinsic** or **extrinsic** semicondutor).
- $n_i$ : density of free electrons in the **intrinsic** semiconductor, this density is considered constant (on $E$), but depends on the material and temperature, for intrinsic Silicon at room temperature ($300°\ \text{K}$) it is equal to: $n_i \simeq 0.881 \cdot 10^{10} \ \text{cm}^{-3}$.
