So now we start with the last type or better one of the last type of sensors, the first **active sensor** which is a **temperature sensor** and it is called **thermocouple**.

Let's start wiht a comparison between **thermocouple**, **RTD**, **thermistor**, **semiconductor**:

- The main difference between this kind of sensor, the **range**.
- ==The most important thing is that both **RTD** and **thermocouples** can operate at **very high temperature** with respect to this kind of sensor here==.
- **Thermocouples have a structure which is really, really simple**.
- Disadvantages and advantages of thermocouples:
	- They need core junctional compensation so the result is not so easy.
	- They have a low voltage output. 
	- Also high accuracy and repeatability.<br>==But the best accuracy you find with RTD sensors==.
- So **thermocouples**: high sensitivity, easy to use highest range and simplest structure
