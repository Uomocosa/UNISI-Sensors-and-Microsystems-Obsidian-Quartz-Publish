##### ***Remeber***:

> ***Reduced Range of [[SaM - Defintion of Thermocouples • Law of Thermocouples • Types of Thermocouples • Extension Wires|thermocouples]]***: The **reduced range** is a range of temperatures more than the actual measurement range of the devices, in this range the error is "fixed".
> ***Extended Range of thermocouples***: While **outside the reduced range**, you have also to account for **an additional error**, which scales with temperature, so the more you are outsude the range, the more the total error will be.

> ***Class I thermocouples***: 
> - **Reduced range**: $[-40°\text{C} \div 375°\text{C}]$, **reduced range error**: $\pm 1°\text{C}$.
> - **Extended range error**: $0.004 °\text{C}^{-1}$<br>So the total error, in the extended range, would be: $1 + 0.004 \cdot T$.

> ***Class II thermocouples***: 
> - **Reduced range**: $[0°\text{C} \div 333°\text{C}]$, **reduced range error**: $\pm 2.5°\text{C}$.
> - **Extended range error**: $0.0075 °\text{C}^{-1}$

And I remember you that the thermocouple obeying to the standard, which is *IEC5842* of *1982*, for **class 1 devices**, we have errors that can be of this entity here:
![[Pasted image 20230719123548.png]]
- THe **reduced range** is a range of temperatures more than the actual measurement range of the devices, class I is $[-40 \div 375°C]$, in this range we can have errors around $1°C$
- Whereas outside, in the **extended range**, you have also to account for **an additional error**, which scales with temperature, so the more you are outsude the range, the more the additional error will be.

Whereas for class 2 devices, we have an error:

- Here we can also see an euivalent circuit for a thermocouple, really simple.
