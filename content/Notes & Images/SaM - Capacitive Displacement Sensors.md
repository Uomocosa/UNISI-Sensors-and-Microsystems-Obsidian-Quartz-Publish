##### Displacement Capacitive Sensors
Here are some example on how you can make a Displacement Capacitive Sensors, using two plate, usually one fixed and one that can move, for clarity:
- $x$ or $y$ : moving axis
- $d$ : distance between the two plates
- $l$: length of the plates
- $w$ width of the plates
- $A = l\cdot w$: area of the plates
- The formula for capacitance is:$$C = \varepsilon \frac{A}{d}$$

- In the last formula is should be: $$C_2 = \varepsilon \frac{w\kern2px l\kern2px y}{d}$$Since for $y=0$ â‡’ $C_2=0$. #NOT_SURE_ABOUT_THIS
