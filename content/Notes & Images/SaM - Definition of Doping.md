- ==Doping is breaking the regular crystal lattice or structure==.<br>It can be performed on those material that have a regular structure. 
- Obviously when we are speaking about doping we imagine to put ==very few defects==.<br>So there is a perturbation of the electronic band structure not a complete mess up. 
- We have **intentional doping**, and this is a process that is applied in the **IC technology**. <br>So when building **integrated circuit** we use **intentional doping** to change and to modify the electrical behavior of some particular and specific area of the crystals. 
- Then you have **unintentional doping**.<br>So it's like having it doped while preparing it, while growing the crystal. <br>So an unintentional doping is simply an imperfect control of the crystal production.
