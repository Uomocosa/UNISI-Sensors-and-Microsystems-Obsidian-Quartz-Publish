==If I have a **passive sensor** then both Norton and Thervenin equivalents becomes the same equivalent, **my sensor behaves just as an impedance**==, so my sensor is this one:

==So now I'm considering this operating and not that there is no sources==. 
==Obviously this kind of sensor will need an excitation==. 
==So the readout circuit, the conditioning circuit or front end circuit should contain an **amplifier**, but also a **power supply** a source of voltage or current, depending on the sensor, even an **ADC** (Analogic to Digital converter) if needed==. 
==So front-end electrocnics are related to the electronics needed to read the sensor, to operate and use the sensor==.
