##### Paraelectric Materials

- This plot represents the [[SaM - Electric Permittivity • Electric Susceptibility • Electric Field|electric susceptibility]] $(\mathcal{X})$, more specifically the relation between the **polarization vector** and the **electric field**: $\vec P = \varepsilon_0 \mathcal{X} \vec E$, that depends on the **electric suceptability**.
- Pyroelectric materials are the subdomain of dielectrics which have polar symmetry, and they exhibit a spontaneous polarization ($P_s$) when there is no applied electric field.<br>In general, polarization is ==caused by the crystalline structure== in the ionically bonded material.<br>==The fluctuation in the temperature causes a change in the polarization and corresponding electric current==.

- ***What is the Difference between Pyroelectric and Ferroelectric Materials?***: (*ChatGPT*)
	- The main difference between pyroelectric and ferroelectric materials lies in their response to temperature changes.
	- **Pyroelectric materials** exhibit a ==spontaneous electric polarization== that changes with temperature.<br>==When subjected to temperature variations, these materials generate a temporary voltage across their surfaces==.<br>==This effect is reversible== and can be utilized in various applications such as infrared detectors.
	- On the other hand, **ferroelectric materials** have a spontaneous electric polarization that can be switched and maintained in the absence of an external electric field.<br>==The polarization direction can be altered by applying an external electric field, and this change remains even after the field is removed==.<br>Ferroelectric materials are commonly used in devices like ferroelectric capacitors and non-volatile memory.
	- In summary, while both pyroelectric and ferroelectric materials involve electric polarization, the key distinction lies in the nature of the response to temperature changes and the ability to retain polarization in the absence of an external field.
