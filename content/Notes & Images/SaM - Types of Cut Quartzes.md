There are different quartz type available.
==They work in frequency up to $30$ **MHz**==.
Their name reflect how they work:

- Thickness shear mode: highest frequency range.

Type of quartzes:

Behaviour of the quartz:

Behaviour of the quartz with respect to temperature:

- **ppm**: part per milion $= 10^{-6}$.
- The slope around $T_A$ is imporant for stability.
