I remember that sensors, now a days, can be divided into two different words:
- **Traditional sensors**. 
- And the other one is the word of **micro machined sensors**, which are called also **MS** or **MEMS**. 

==Micro machine sensors are based on the **IC technology**, IC stands for **integrated circuit**, so this sensors exploit the same technology that is used to realize the **IC** (integrated circuits)==. 
==And so it exploits, a technology able to have mass production, a technology which is the top level technology, and a technology which allows the integration of the electronics, which can be: **frontend + conversion + processing**, along with the **sensor**==. 
==So sensor and all the electronics needed to read the sensor, and to manage the sensor, are realized on the same silicone chip==. 

==Due to the integration here, we have a **good control** over the sensor, so we find reproducible sensor and **cheap sensors**==. 
==Also we can reach **very good signal to noise ratio** because noise rejection is made possible by integrating by putting the front end close to the sensor==. 

==The main difference between these two classes, is that **MEMS sensors are NOT suitable for harsh conditions**==. 
==And moreover, since they are very small structures, sometimes the full range, the measurement ranges of the devices are lower==.
