We started by saying that at $0$ **Kelvin** all the electrons are here in the **Valence Band**, and no electrons are in the **Conduction Band**. 
*What happens when we go to a temperature which is different from $0$ Kelvin?* 
To understand this, we have to look at the **probability that an electron occupies a given energy state (or level)**.

*==The **Fermi-Dirac distribution** $f_e(E)$ gives the ***probability*** that given a certain energy state with an energy level value $E$, this value $E$ is occupied by the electron*==, and it is defined as follows:$$f_e(E) = \frac{1}{1+ e^{\large \frac{ E-E_f}{kT}}}$$Where:
- $E$ is the energy that the electron takes. 
- $k$ is the **Boltzmann constant** $= 1.380649 \cdot 10^{-23} \, {\text{J}\over\text{K}}$. 
- $T$ is the temperature in **Kelvin**. 
- Whereas $E_F$ is a special energy level, which is called "***Fermi Energy***", this quantity also [[SaM - Dependence of the Fermi Energy on Temperature|changes with temperature]].
