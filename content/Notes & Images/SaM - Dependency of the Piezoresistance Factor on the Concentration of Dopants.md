We find that for weekly [[SaM - Doping of Silicon|doped silicon]], suppose of $n$-type, where the density of donors is smaller than this density here:<br>![[Pasted image 20230610193848.png]]
We have also a **weak dependence on the doping level**. 
Whereas for heavily doped silicon, you have a large and strong dependence on doping:<br>![[Pasted image 20230610193928.png]]

- ==As the concentration of Boron increases (an acceptor, **p-type doped silicon**, more holes) the piezoresistance factor decreases==
- The piezoresistance factor of silicon can be influenced by the presence of dopants, including Boron.<br>==The concentration of Boron atoms in the silicon lattice can affect the material's electrical properties, including its resistivity and piezoresistive behavior==. <br>Higher Boron concentrations can lead to increased scattering of charge carriers, which can impact the piezoresistive response.

You can see that the doping level, which is concentration of dopants can change also the **temperature coefficient of resistivity**.
We know that this is not something good for a strain gauge.
It should be independent in temperature, instead as you can see it has a large value, actually.

And here for **temperature coefficient of sensitivity**

⇒ So better behavior for larger concentration of boron.
