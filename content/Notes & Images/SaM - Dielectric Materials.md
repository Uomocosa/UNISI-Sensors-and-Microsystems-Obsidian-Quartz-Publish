- Just remember the static description:$$\vec D = \varepsilon \vec E$$We will see it again, and with more details in the [[SaM - Electric Permittivity • Electric Susceptibility • Electric Field|electric permittivity lecture]].
- We have seen the [[SaM - Complex Electric Permittivity|complex electric permettivity]], a **dielectric material** has only a **real** electric permettivity, so: #NOT_SURE_ABOUT_THIS $$\varepsilon \in \mathbb{R}$$
- ***What is a Dielectric Material?*** (*ChatGPT*)
	- A dielectric is a material that is typically an electrical insulator and does not conduct electric current easily.
	- Dielectrics are often used in electrical and electronic devices to separate or insulate conductive components.
	- They are characterized by their ability to become polarized when subjected to an electric field.
