If we were consider a [[SaM - 2 Wires Measurement with Wire Resisitances|2 wires measurement system]], we would have a meaured reistance value:$$R_{\small{\text{MEASURED}}} = R(T) + R_{{\small W1}} + R_{{\small W2}} $$Instead if we use 4 wires, like so:

Now the measured value, if $R_{{\small W1}} \approx R_{{\small W2}}$, is exactly $R(T)$.
