Remember that the [[SaM - Conductivity and Mobility of Intrisinc Silicon|conductivity]] of [[SaM - Instrinsic Semiconductor • Density of Carriers • Energy Gap and Carriers Dependance on Temperature|semiconductors]] also depends on **temperature**, as we can see in the following graph:
![[Lecture 6_230911_165051_8 1.jpg|500]]
- **Specifically this graph represents the conductivity of [[SaM - Doping of Silicon|n-type doped silicon]]**.
- $N_D^{+}$ represents the density of "ionazied" donors.<br>For n-type silicon this is because the dopants lose an electron in favor of the atoms of silicon, in the material.<br>**NOTE**: The ionazied term means the dopants that contribuite to conduction, so the "active" dopants.<br>*~Ex.: in case of donors the electron that from the "donors extrinsix band" ($E_D$) has gone to the condution band*.

The conductivity depends on temperature also for metals, but the graph is vastly different:
