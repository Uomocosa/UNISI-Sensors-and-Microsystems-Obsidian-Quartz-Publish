Thermopiles are devices which aims at enhancing the sensitivity because they are **composed by a series of [[SaM - Defintion of Thermocouples • Law of Thermocouples • Types of Thermocouples • Extension Wires|thermocouples]]**:

- We have two region, one at $T_1$, one at $T_2$.
- A thermopile composed by $N$ thermocouple will increment the outptu value of the sensor, and so also its accuracy by a factor $N$.
- You have a very small size for the sensing device and whereas the wires can be long.
