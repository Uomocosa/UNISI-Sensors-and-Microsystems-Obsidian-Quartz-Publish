*So which is the solution for [[SaM - Electrical Noise|this problem]] we have seen now?*
We need **shields**.
![[Pasted image 20230718201053.png]]
- This is an **electrical shield**, that means a metallic surface, and by putting this surface to a fixed voltage, usually ground, we avoid to have any part of the circuit exposed to external electrical field.<br>Because you know that inside the closed metallic surface, the electrical field is zero, **due to the high mobility of charges**.
- Shields are especially useful when I can't use a current amplifier.<br>So a very low input resistance frontend.
- Since we are speaking about quite low frequencies, we enclose everything (Here I put only the cable because it's the most large exposed metallic part, so the most prone to disturbances, but possibly we would want to enclose everything)
- This time, this new $C_{\text{COUP}}$ is for sure much smaller than the one we have seen before, because the area which is not enclosed in the metal shield is as small as possible.
