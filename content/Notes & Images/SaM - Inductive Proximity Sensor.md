Here is a scheme on how we can use a [[SaM - Magnetic Lumped Parameter System • Electro-Motive Force • Variable Reluctance|magnetic circuit]], to make a **proximity sensor**, like so:<br>![[Pasted image 20230719112354.png|500]]
- We consider to have a **ferromagnetic target**.
- $I$ is the current flowing here generated by the electric circuit.
- The core has relative [[SaM - Magnetic Permeability • Magnetic Susceptibility • Magnetic Field|permeability]] $\mu_r$, which is large. 
-  $S_1$: the cross area. 
- We expect that the flux line will develop with this geometry here, so:
	- Half circle: $\pi R$
	- Small gap: $l_g$
	- Straith line: $2R$

The inductance value will be: #IMPORTANTE $$L = {N^2 \over \mathcal{R}_0 \left( 1 + \alpha_T \kern2px l_g\right)}$$Here are the calculations:<br>(*NOT IMPORTANT*)<br>![[Pasted image 20230719112400.png|500]]
- So we have all these surfaces, which have the same magnitude order, but we have these two $\mu_1$ and $\mu_T$, which really are reallyh larger than $\mu_0$.
- so we expect $\frac{2l_g}{\mu_0 S_g}$ to be the most important, even if $\lg \ll R$, the order of magnitude of $\mu_0$ and $\mu_T$ is bigger.

The sensitivity will be: #IMPORTANTE $$\alpha_T = \frac{l_g}{R\kern2px S_g} \frac{\mu_T}{\mu_0}$$Where:
- $R$ : is fixed due to the sensor. 
- $S_T$ and $\mu_T$ depend on the material, of the target.<br>⇒ So you see that the sensitivity $\alpha$ this depends on the target, so ($\alpha_T$)<br>⇒ So you change the material of the target, you change the sensitivity.<br>⇒ The larger is $\mu_T$, the larger is the sensitivity. 

You can use the same arrangement to sense a variation of the reluctance due to the gap variation, ==even if the target is **not** ferromagnetic==, but in that case you will have really small sensitivity.

It's quite similar to what happens for a [[SaM - Capacitive Proximity Sensors|capacitive sensor]], ==but here I have a dependence on the **material type**==.

Here's an example of how we can exite and read the sensor:<br>![[Pasted image 20230719112417.png]]
- I have an electrical circuit for exciting ($V_g$), and another one for sensing, called "**sensing coil**" ($V_o$).
- Using this setup, usually, the frequency needed to have a sufficiently strong signal are much lower than those used for capacitive sensing.<br>In capacitive sensing we have said that we use $10kHz \div MHz$.<br>Here, usually since signals are larger, $f_{\text{exc}}$ is less than $20 \kern2px kHz$.
