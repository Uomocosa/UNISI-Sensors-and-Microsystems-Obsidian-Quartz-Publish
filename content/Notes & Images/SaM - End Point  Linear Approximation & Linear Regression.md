Sometimes they take the so called end point approximation so you start from. 
==If you take the two end points and join them with a line and this is the so called **end point linear approximation**==:<br>![[Pasted image 20230417153753.png]]
Which is taken as ideal behavior of your sensor.
==Or this one here which can be a **linear regression**==:<br>![[Pasted image 20230417153940.png]]
And this is another possibility to find the ideal behavior even the real behavior. 
So okay we have understood the ideal sensor.
