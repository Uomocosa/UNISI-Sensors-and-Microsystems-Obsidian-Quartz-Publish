- We convert a displacement in a resistances.
- Using a sliding contact, we change the length of the resistance $l=x$, that in this case can be a simple metal object, with fixed (and omogenus) surface area $S$, and also omogenus resistivity $\rho$.
- We have that the total resistance will be:$$R(x) = \rho \frac{x}{S}$$
