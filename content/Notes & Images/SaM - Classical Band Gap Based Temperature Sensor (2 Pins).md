we look at a device which can be considered like the current generator where the current generated depends on $T$:
![[Pasted image 20230923170203.png]]
- The user has to select the value of $R$, so ti is an external resistance.
- At the top of the generator we have a current mirror, therefore here you have $I_C$ and here you have the same $I_C$ and here we have the structure as we have discussed before.
- So same as before, except for $R$ that in this case has to be selected by the user.

Actually there are also integrated circuit that behaves not as current generatosr but has voltage generators.
**Voltage Outptut (2 Pins)**:

- The two pins are $-$ and $+$, the voltage drop between the two ($V(T)$) is the output.
- This time we have this voltage here which is regulated by the current flowing here by this $V_{BE}$ which we know is proportional to the temperature.
