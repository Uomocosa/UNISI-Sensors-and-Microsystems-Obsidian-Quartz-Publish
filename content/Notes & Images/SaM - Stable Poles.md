Remember what is a **stable pole**: **real part of the poles smaller than zero**:<br>![[Pasted image 20230624211806.png]]

We can see this par here as if it was composed by a **persistent output** in time domain, and the **vanishing transient response** in time domain: <br>![[Pasted image 20230624212015.png]]
- The persistent part here is due to the poles of $G(s)$. 
- The vanishing part here is due to the poles of $H(s)$.
