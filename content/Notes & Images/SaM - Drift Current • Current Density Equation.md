***Transport Current = Motion of Electrons***:
$$\vec J_n = \sigma_n \vec E + q D_n (\nabla \cdot n)$$
In one dimension:$$ J_n = \sigma_n E $$
Velocity of an electron:
$$\vec v = \frac{q \tau}{m_e^*}\vec E$$
Relation between the ***avereage time between collisions*** ($\tau$) and the ***average free path*** ($\lambda$):$$\tau = \frac{\lambda}{V_{TH}}$$Where $v_{TH}$ is called the "***mean thermal velocity***", and it is defined as:$$V_{TH} = 4 \sqrt{\frac{kT}{2\pi m_e^*}}$$The **transport current**, supposing an symmetrical distribution of carriers (so: $\nabla \cdot n = 0$), will be equal to:$$\begin{align}
\vec J_n &  = n q \vec v
\\[3px]
& = \frac{n q^2 \tau}{m_e^*}\vec E
\\[3px]
& = \sigma_n \vec E
\\[3px]
& = n q \mu_n E
\end{align}$$

- ==The time between collision ($\tau$), at $300$ **Kelvin**, is about $1 \over 10$ of a **picosecond**==. 
- ==While the free path ($\lambda$) is about $10$ **nanometer**==, this represents the length in average, that the electrons travels without colliding with another atom.
