There are some materials, usually [[SaM - Special Materials for the Electric Permittivity • Paraelectric, Piezoelectric, Ferroelectric|ferroelectric materials]], where we have a relationship between the [[SaM - Electric Permittivity • Electric Susceptibility • Electric Field|permittivity]] and the temperature, like this:
![[Pasted image 20230718200818 - Copy 1.png]]
- $K$ : constant depending on the material, we have not seen it in details.
- $T$ : temperature (as always in $\left[°K\right]$)
- $T_c$  : [[SaM - Compact Piezoelectric Coefficient Matrix for PZT • Dependence of Piezoelectricity on Temperature • Curie Temperature|Curie temperature]].
- And so by exploiting this relationship between the permittivity and the temperature (much like we did with [[SaM - Capacitive Humidity Sensor|humidity sensors]]) we can have devices based on these ferroelectric materials.
- Again like many capacitive sensor, we have a slice of the material incapsulated by two metallic surfaces.
- ==Actually the capacitive sensors for temperature are **really rare** because we know that we have many other [[SaM - Different Types of Temperature Sensors|types of sensors]], among which there are **[[SaM - Definition of RTD Sensors • Resistive Temperatrure Detector Sensors • TCR (Temperature Coefficient of Resitance)|resistive sensors which are very effective]]**==.
