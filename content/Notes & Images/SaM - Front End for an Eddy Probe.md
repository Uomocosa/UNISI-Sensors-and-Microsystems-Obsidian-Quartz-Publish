This circuit uses an [[SaM - Eddy Currents â€¢ Eddy Probe|Eddy Probe]], to represent it I use the symbol of the inductance with 2 lines in front ($Z_2$):<br>![[immagine_2023-09-21_160434259-transformed 1.png|500]]
- We need a [[SaM - Carrier Amplifier|carrier amplifier]], a **synchronous demodulator**, and a [[SaM - Logarithmic Amplifier|logarithmic amplifier]].
- In this case, there is another probe ($Z_1$), which is not exposed to the target, it's not facing the target, and it's in an **enclosed** situation.<br>==It is used only to compensate the temperature effect on the actual sensor==, since the coil and also the resistance are sensitive to temperature.
