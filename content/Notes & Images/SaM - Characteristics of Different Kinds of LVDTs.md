#IMPORTANTE 
There exists many different kinds of [[SaM - LVDT Sensor (Linear Variable Differential Transformer) • Transformers • Magnetic Induction|LVDT sensors]], their characteristics vary a lot:

- They operate between $1$ **Volt** and $24$ **Volts** for instance.<br>And the frequency we have already said it's a range of this type, so from $50\ \text{Hz}$ to $20\ \text{kHz}$ in general.
- The [[SaM - Working Range & Safe Range|full scale]] of this kind of devices can go from $\pm 100$ **micrometers** up to $\pm 25$ **centimeters**, so very different.
- The [[SaM - Resolution|resolution]] can arrive to $0.1$ **micrometer** (**precise devices**).
- The [[SaM - Non-Linearity Error|non-linearity error]] is below $1\%$.
- Also here you see how the [[SaM - Sensitivity|sensitivity]] is defined, not very useful.<br>This way of defining the unit of measure of the sensitivity: $V / x / V$ or $V / V / \text{cm}$ means that ==the sensitivity also depends on the input voltage==, the higher the voltage, the higher the sensitivity, ==the real unit of measure of the sensitivity is $1 \over \text{m}$==.<br>Also remember we [[SaM - LVDT Sensor (Linear Variable Differential Transformer) • Transformers • Magnetic Induction|defined previously]] the input voltage for LVDTs as "$E_1$".
