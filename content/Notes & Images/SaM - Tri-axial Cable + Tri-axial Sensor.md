The best thing that can be done with [[SaM - Driven Shields or Tri-Axial Cable|this kind of measurements]] is use this special cables which are the [[SaM - Driven Shields or Tri-Axial Cable|tri-axial cables]], and **tri-axial sensors**.

Difference between a [[SaM - Capacitive Proximity Sensors|normal proximity sensor]], and a tri-axial sensor:
![[Pasted image 20230718201222.png]]
- The inner shield in a tri-axial sensor is **driven**, so it is kept at a voltage $V$, same as the source voltage of the inner sensor.
- The field in the normal sensor, is bend at the edges, instead for a tri-axial sensor that is not the case, we consider the field as "*almost ideal*".
- You can imagine that in a tri-axial sensor, it's like having a continuous plate, If this $w$ gap is small (an "insulating gap"), then it's like having a continuous plate here.
- In the tri-axial sensor, the "**guard system**", prevents the fact of distortion of the field due to something outside the sensing area.
