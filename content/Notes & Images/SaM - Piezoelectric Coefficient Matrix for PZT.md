Small recap on **PZT**:
- **PZT** (_Lead Zirconate Titanate_, _polycrystal_) : _large piezo-coefficients_ $(d_{33} = 500 \ {\text{pC} \over \text{N}})$
- **PZT** which usually is a [[SaM - Microstructure of Solids|polycrystal]], and since the crystals inside a polycrystal are randomly oriented in order to have an overall ordered behavior, so ti presents an isotropic behavior (so no piezoelectric behaviour), ==this material needs to be polarized before using==, so it is produced in due reproduction with strong electrical field which gives alignment for all the electrical domains, so for all the crystals, and therefore at the end we have an **overall piezoelectric behavior**.

- It should be a $3 \times 3 \times 3$ matrix but we can represent it into a compact notation as a $3 \times 6$ matrix.
- This should be because **PZT** is generally considered an [[SaM - Definition of Isotropic and Anisotropic Materials|anisotropic material]]. #NOT_SURE_ABOUT_THIS 
- ***Why can I represent the piezoelectric coefficient matrix of PZT as a $3 \times 6$ matrix instead of a $3 \times 3 \times 3$ matrix?*** (ChatGPT)
	- The $3 \times 6$ matrix is a more compact representation that takes into account this symmetry.<br>It contains **six independent coefficients**:
	- Three independent coefficients for the **direct piezoelectric effect** (strain inducing polarization) and three for the **inverse piezoelectric effect** (polarization inducing strain).
