==The transient which depends on the poles of $H(s)$==.
==And this is the steady state, this is because you know that for the **theorem of the final value** this is equal to==:<br>![[Pasted image 20230624215638.png]]

==If I give to the sensor an input of this type here, so an input which is step function.
The output is something wich vanishes: a transient part which becomes so small than I can neglect it. 
After a time which is related to $5 \kern2px \tau_{i_{MAX}}$, we have a steady state response which last forever and ever, which is the amplitude of the input multiplied by the sensitivity==.

- ==And this is also equal to the sensitivity of the sensor $\alpha$==. 
- So from now on ==from now on I'll call this **DC gain**==, it gives me the steady state response of the sensor. 

If I use as input function:

==So remember that the transfer function tells us very easily what happens to the steady state response of any harmonic input==, and remember it because we will use it a lot.

*And why is this is important?*
This is important because I know that under some large conditions ==any signal can be written as the super-imposition of sine and cosine wave at different frequencies by means of the **Fourier transform** or the **Fourier series**==. 
==So if I know what happens to one harmonic I can generalize to any shape of signal and passing through the Fourier transform or the Fourier series==.
