When using this kind of sensor which are the so called **charge output sensors**, there are some problems because you use long cables who have seen the parasitic capacitance of the cables somehow is mitigated.
But what happens with a long cable is that this long cable can couple a lot of electric noise with the circuit itself.
![[Pasted image 20230719131025.png]]
- So you see that the source of the signal is a very high impedance source, we need in any case, **shielded cables**.
- Instead, charge output means having an high impedance source, therefore, ==shielding is of the upmost importance==. 
- We need shielded cables, and we need also to select a good quality cable because sometimes shielded cables are made up, so the external shield is made up of a network of metallic wires.
- And for long cables, this can be a problem because remember we have a very small signal and a very high impedance source, so the electrical noise has to be shielded out completely.
- But there are also other problems related to noise for this kind of devices, which is the noises that are actually generated for instance in the cable.


So ==a problem is **triboelectric noise** generated in the cable==.
- ***What is the triboelectric effect?***
	- The triboelectric noise, also known as **triboelectric charging**, is a phenomenon where certain materials become electrically charged when they come into contact with each other and then separate.<br>This charging occurs due to the transfer of electrons between the materials during the contact and separation process.

Suppose we use a **coaxial cable**, it is essentially made of 5 layers:
1. **Inner Conductor** or **Wire**
2. **1st Insulation**
3. **Outer Conductor** or **Elettromagnetic Shield**     
4. **2nd Insulation**   
5. **Outer Jacket** or **Durable Shield** (in particular this shield provides mechanical protection and shields the cable from environmental factors like moisture and physical damage)

Therefore, we have **different materials** and if this materials move one respect to the other for some reason, for instance for a movement of the cable itself, then ==there may be some charge which is generated for the triboelectric effect==.
So the cable generates a charge like the sensor does, it can't be distinguished from the signal itself.
⇒ So also ==the selection of the cable materials is important==, there are special cables for this kind of devices in case we need very long cable, or in case we expect the cable to vibrate.

In any case, ==the cable length should be kept at the minimum==, because there are also the ==electrical noise generated by the amplifier, which is somehow amplified by the length of the cable==.

Remeber that the noise generated internally in an amplifier can be modeled this way:
![[Pasted image 20230719131036.png]]
- So we take the amplifier normal without any noise.
- And we place two different noise generator:<br>One is a current generator $I_N$, the other one is the voltage generator $E_N$.
- This is a model of a generic amplifier, which takes into account also the noise, which the amplifier generates internally.
- So this allows to study the effect of noise on the signal amplification.
- We start by anylizing only the noises effect so we consider $Q_p = 0$.

So continuing the calculations:
![[Pasted image 20230719131048.png]]
- So even if we consider $R_f$ really big, we now encounter again the dependency of the output on the cable length, via the term $E_N \left(1+\frac{C_T}{C_f}\right)$, since $C_T = C_E + C_C$ and $C_C$ is the cable capacitance, which of course depends on its length.
- We can define this noises as an equivalent charge that accumulates in $C_f$. ($Q_{N_{eq}}$)<br>"We can also find an equivalent noise by taking $V_{N0}$ and multiplying it by $C_f$, because this is, let's say, the relationship between this charge and the output at the first approximation".
- The formula is a bit of a mess, so here it is again:$$Q_{N_{eq}} = - \frac{I_N}{j \omega} + E_N\left(C_T + C_f\right)$$
- This additional charge can be considered as a **DC offset** of the system (that depends linearly on the lenght of the cable), and has to be summed to the other **DC errors** of the amplifier, and as you can see you have to carefully select this $R_f$ in order to take in a limited range the DC error.<br>But remeber $R_f$ must not be too small otherwise you will charge the capacitance $C_f$ via the bias current and noise current generator (which is worse that having a DC offeset).
- So you have to select a low noise current amplifier, and the right cable.
